The Index of Economic Freedom is a tool that measures the degree of economic freedom in countries around the world, aiming to assess the extent to which a nation's policies and institutions support economic prosperity. It's a composite measure, looking at various factors like trade freedom, tax burden, and judicial effectiveness, to determine a country's overall economic freedom score. This score is often used to analyze the relationship between economic freedom and economic growth, investment, and income levels.
